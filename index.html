        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Avipreet Singh, a science student at Capilano University in my second year. My journey here has been remarkable, thanks to the wonderful professors and engaging experiences. Fueled by a passion for computer science, I eagerly enrolled in Comp165, dedicating myself to mastering the subject and indulging in coding whenever possible. I'm excited about the prospect of learning and growing through this course.</p>
